<h2>Nice to meet you</h2>

<div>
    <h3>I’m Yamu - a Toronto-based designer with a passion for creating thoughtful, user-centered digital experiences.</h3>
    <p>My design approach is rooted in empathy. I believe great design starts with understanding people’s needs, and I strive to craft intuitive, functional interfaces that solve real problems. I see UI elements as puzzle pieces, each with a purpose that comes together to create seamless, accessible experiences.</p>
    <p>Accessibility is a principle I design by; it’s also personal. Growing up with a visually impaired father, I witnessed the everyday barriers that poorly designed technology can create. This shaped my commitment to inclusive design, ensuring that the products I build are not only usable but also welcoming to everyone.</p>
    <p>I’ve always been curious about the digital world. Raised between the early internet and the iPad kid era, I naturally gravitated toward technology and design. That curiosity led me to pursue an Advanced Diploma in Interaction Design, and I’m currently deepening my front-end skills with a postgraduate certification in Front-End Web Design at George Brown College.</p>
    <p>I’m now looking for a UX/UI position where I can collaborate with passionate teams, continue learning, and contribute to meaningful, user-focused design work.</p>

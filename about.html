<h2>About</h2>

<div>
    <h3>Nice to meet you, I'm Yamu, a designer based in Toronto, Canada.</h3>
    <p>My design philosophy is empathy-based, putting users' needs first. I’m passionate about crafting functional, user-centered interfaces and continuously expanding my skills across various design disciplines to create better products. I see interface elements as puzzle pieces that need to be put together to meet user needs.</p>
    <p>I’m deeply passionate about accessibility and committed to making my designs universally inclusive. Growing up with a visually impaired father, I witnessed firsthand the challenges differently-abled users face when interacting with technology. This experience instilled in me a strong drive to create interfaces that are not only functional but truly accessible. My goal is to make technology and design usable for everyone.</p>
    <p>Born between the dawn of the internet and the age of the iPad kid, I grew up exploring the digital world, which sparked my curiosity about technology. This passion led me to pursue a postgraduate degree in Interaction Design, and I’m currently furthering my expertise with a postgraduate certification in Front-End Web Design at George Brown College.</p>

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Dayforce is an all-in-one Human Capital Management (HCM) platform that streamlines HR processes, supports workforce management, and connects employers with employees. It offers a centralized solution for handling employee services efficiently.</p>

            <div id="row3">
                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>The project originally began as an academic assignment to conduct a heuristic evaluation of a website, identify pain points(usability issues), and redesign it based on the findings. After submitting the initial version, I saw further potential in the project and decided to iterate it for my portfolio.</p>
                <p>Revamping case studies like this allows me to uncover overlooked design problems and craft better solutions. Based on my personal experiences as a regular Dayforce user due to my part-time job, I was already familiar with its usability challenges and knew where improvements could be made.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="row4">
                <h3>Objectives</h3>
                <p>My main objective was to address usability pain points through design solutions. One key focus was optimizing unused screen space to enhance potential functionality. Overall, the redesign aimed to elevate both the UI and UX, improving user productivity and satisfaction.</p>
